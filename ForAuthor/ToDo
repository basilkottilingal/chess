~~1)  FEN update;~~
2)  binary history : {board (charx64), move(ucharx6 = from:ucharx2 + to:ucharx2 +flags:uchar+promotion:uchar)}
3)  cross platform compatibility. 32 board compatible; 
4)  square() shouldn't be part of board; rather it's an iterator;
5)  Naive Evaluate of the bitboard;
6)  MPI: (a) Tree generation, (b) Tree travesal
    (c) avoid recreation of same node. (use hash function) 
~~7)  include NNUE (give credit)~~
8)  write your own NNUE; (Can you dow it in C?? Too much)
9)  websocket: (a) uninterrupted game interface, (b) using ligtweight C code
10) (a) Minimax 
    (b) Alpha-Beta Pruning
    (c)
    
12) Memory evaluation. To check memory allocated and free are equal during the entire program;

Tree should be modified as
Node = {uchar ** Board, uchar metadata[]} //Minimal. Board shouldn't malloc(); Get allocated from an already created memBlock;
Edge = {Node * from, GameMove move};   
Tree = {Node * root, Edge ** edges}
